# Flutter Storyboard

A Flutter based application to showcase your custom widgets in your app that helps in easy review of the design. 
Features of the Flutter Storyboard:Â 
1. Reduction in time of Review process.
2. Easy and fast Design-to-app process.
3. Verify how your widget will react to changing themes.
4. Copy the code of the widget for easy implementation [TODO].

## Project Structure

Our project will consist of multiple screens, namely Screen 1, Screen 2 and so on (aptly named) and some Common UI Widget that will be shared across multiple screens. And under each screen, we will have the desired components that we need that make up that screen, namely Widget 1, Widget 2 (aptly named too). And each widget will have different states.


## Implementation looks like this:
